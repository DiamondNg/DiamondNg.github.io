## Theravada and Transgender

Transgender means a person is born or assigned a certain gender and growing up, they identify as another gender. Using current technology, it is possible to apply hormonal therapy if the person has not gone through puberty yet, however, it would be very hard to reverse and has a lot of consequences should the person regret it later. In Theravada, the gender switching is spontenous and can be switched back without seemingly much complications. 

I am using Theravada because I would be using some source which would not qualify as Early Buddhism. There is a notion of gender switching in the Vinaya and one of the commentarial stories.
